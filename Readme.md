# HomeRepair-MobileApp

Welcome to my Mobile application called(At this time) Home Repair!
The purpose of this application is to allow users to have an authenticated platform to communicate with other business that can fulfil their specific needs,
handling the exchange of information carefully and securely, without the need to 'google' and take unneccassary risks when reaching out to some companies they are unfimiliar with.
This will allow a safe and secure environment for both users and businesses.

Here you can have a user to Sign up

And Log In

Using a firebase Database with Bearer Authentication for the users.
You will then be directed to the Home screen
